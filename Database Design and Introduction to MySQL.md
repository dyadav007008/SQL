# Database Design and Introduction to MySQL

# Database Design

- An organisation cannot track its business activities efficiently by maintaining a large number of files. Hence, databases are used for accessing and managing data efficiently. A software known as Database Management System (DBMS) is used widely in the industry to analyse data easily.

# What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a collection of data. It has the following properties:

- **Subject-oriented:** A data warehouse should contain information about a few well-defined subjects rather than the enterprise.
- **Integrated:** A data warehouse is an integrated repository of data. It contains information from various systems within an organisation.
- **Non-volatile:** The data values in a database cannot be changed without a valid reason.
- **Time-variant:** A data warehouse contains historical data for analysis.

- A data warehouse would thus be the central repository of data of the entire enterprise.
- OLAP, which stands for Online Analytical Processing systems. OLAP is used to extract business-relevant information and perform analysis on the data stored in data warehouses.
