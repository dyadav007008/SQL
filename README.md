#SQL

# Overview
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). SQL-like languages can also be used in Relational Data Stream Management Systems (RDSMS), or in "not-only SQL" (NoSQL) databases.
SQL comprises of 3 major sub-languages:
1. Data Definition Language (DDL): to create and modify the structure of the database;
2. Data Manipulation Language (DML): to perform Read, Insert, Update and Delete operations on the data of the database;
3. Data Control Language (DCL): to control the access of the data stored in the database.

# Identifier
identifiers are used to refer to database objects such as tables, columns, views, indexes, schemas, and other objects within the database. They help the SQL engine to identify and access specific objects in the database.

## Types of Identifiers in SQL
- Table Identifiers: Refers to the names of tables in the database.
- Column Identifiers: Refers to the names of columns in a table.
- Schema Identifiers: Refers to the schema in which the table or other objects reside.
- Database Identifiers: Refers to the name of a database itself.
- Alias Identifiers: Temporary names given to tables or columns during query execution.
